# Output format

**Short by default.** The reader should be able to act after the first screen, then ask
for more. Say less and offer the rest.

## Format is chosen automatically — never ask

| Input | Format |
|---|---|
| One screenshot or one frame | **Quick triage** |
| Several frames, a flow, code, or a live URL | **Full report** |

If the person says "quick look" or "full audit", do that instead.

## Length limits

| Part | Limit |
|---|---|
| Verdict | 2 sentences |
| Fix in this order | ≤ 5 rows |
| Task walkthrough | ≤ 6 rows + 1 closing line |
| Findings | ≤ 6 written out; the rest as one line each under **Also noticed** |
| Each finding | Observed ≤ 2 sentences · ≤ 2 heuristics · Cost 1 sentence · 1 row per fix tier |
| Working well | ≤ 3 bullets |
| Tensions | Only if real · ≤ 2 sentences |
| Over to you | ≤ 4 questions |

Leave out by default: precedents, background, technical evidence, extra fix tiers. The
closing line offers them.

## Labelling

| Thing | Written as |
|---|---|
| Heuristic | `H1`–`H9` with its name: `H2 Clarity and straightforwardness` |
| Finding | `Finding 1`, `Finding 2`… — **never `F1`** |
| Fix tier | `Quick` / `Structural` / `Foundational` |
| Severity | 🔴 **Blocker** · 🟠 **High** · 🟡 **Medium** · 🟢 **Low** · ⚪ **Can't assess** — emoji and word, always |
| Walkthrough step | ✅ as expected · ⚠️ friction · ❌ breaks — never mixed with severity |

- Finding heading is exactly `Finding N, <severity> · <outcome>`. No heuristics in it.
- Heuristics go in a bulleted list under **Observed**, one short clause each.
- `H` only ever means heuristic.

## Findings

### Finding 1, 🟠 High · [Outcome in plain words]

**Observed** — [Quoted string, location or measurement. ≤ 2 sentences.]

**Heuristics**
- **H2 Clarity and straightforwardness** — [the breach]

**Cost** — [Demand + consequence, 1 sentence.]

**Fix**

| Tier | Action |
|---|---|
| Quick | [Concrete fix] |

> Before: "…" · After: "…"   ← copy fixes only

### Also noticed
- 🟢 [One line per extra finding]

## Working well
- **[What works]** (H1) — [one line]

## Tensions
**H1 ↔ H9.** [Who wins for this task, and why — 2 sentences max.]

## Over to you — I couldn't test these

| | Question | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| ☐ | **[Question the reader can answer in seconds?]** [Optional one-line context.] | H1 |

Ask me to expand any finding, show the evidence, or suggest more fixes.

## Worked finding — calibration

### Finding 1, 🟠 High · The number field never shows the format it requires

**Observed** — The only instruction is "Ingrese el número de Expediente". The field
silently requires `000000-000000-00`, and the error says only "El formato del número
ingresado no es correcto".

**Heuristics**
- **H8 Resilience and error tolerance** — the error withholds the rule
- **H3 Assistance** — no example at the field

**Cost** — Decision-making: the person retries blind or gives up.

**Fix**

| Tier | Action |
|---|---|
| Quick | Show `Formato: 000000-000000-00 (ej. 980000-000102-02)` beside the field and in the error. |
| Structural | Insert the hyphens as the person types. |

## Writing rules

**Walkthrough**
- Take the most likely path, not the correct one.
- Describe steps in the person's terms, not the interface's.
- Every ⚠️ and ❌ links to a finding. Close with one line: steps, dead ends, done or not.

**Over to you**
- **Question first, in bold**; context after, plain. The bold part must stand alone.
- Answerable in seconds. Say when a severity depends on the answer.
- ❌ *I found 0 `prefers-reduced-motion` blocks in 3,297 CSS rules… Does anything change?*
- ✅ ***Turn on "reduce motion" and reload. Does anything look different?*** *I found no sign the site responds to it.*

**Plain language** — keep the numbers, cut the code.

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "`input[name='url']` at y=173" | "The large search box in the banner" |
| "`.subline a` 9.33px, 3.54:1" | "The details line is 9px light grey" |
| "`localStorage` is empty" | "The choice isn't remembered between visits" |

Technical terms are fine in the Fix column and inside quoted interface copy.

**Tensions** — resolve with `conflicts.md`: name both heuristics, say who wins for this
task and why. Delete the section if there are none.

## Rules

- Quote the real string. Write the replacement. Never "make it clearer".
- Name the cognitive demand in **Cost**.
- A label must be **visible** to count — never prescribe `aria-label` or a tooltip as the fix.
- Verify a negative before reporting it — a dead control may be your tooling.
- "A neurodivergent person may…", never "neurodivergent people are…".
- Critique the artifact, never the people who made it.
